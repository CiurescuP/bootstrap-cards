# boostrap-cards
After finishing my 6 months Web Development course, I was really scared of Bootstrap. Not working with it in the course, I had no idea what it really was. After my own researches here and there, I went straight in and created three basic CSS cards. I was really proud of myself because I caught on quickly and the cards were created in a maximum of 20 minutes. I was really amazed to see how much people in IT help other people, strangers really.
